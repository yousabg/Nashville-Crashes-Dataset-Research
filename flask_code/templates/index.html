        <h2 class="h4 mb-3 text-custom">Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project delves into the multifaceted reasons behind traffic accidents in the U.S., utilizing the extensive Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset and a detailed dataset from Nashville. Through rigorous data analysis, we aim to uncover patterns and factors contributing to accidents, from common causes like drunk driving and speed, to less apparent factors such as demographic differences.</p>
